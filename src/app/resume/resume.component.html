      <td><b>Why I Am The Perfect Choice</b>
        <p>I am currently working towards a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science at Weber State University.
          I have finished and received an Associates Degree with Certificates of Proficiency
          in Computer Fundamentals and Web Development from Salt Lake Community College. I am
          a single class away from receiving a third certificate in Software Development and I
          enjoy technology so much that I plan to earn a fourth certificate in Mobile Development
          as well. I am also teaching myself Ruby on Rails on the side. I am a quick learner and
          enjoy learning anything I can about computers and how to program them. I have a
          competitive personality and try to be the best at everything I do. I will work hard
          to accomplish my tasks, keep deadlines, and to learn and develop my skills to provide the best
          work experience possible for myself and my peers.</p></td>
