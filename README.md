# MyAngular2Proj

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.24.

## Purpose
This project was created in an effort to reproduce all of the web design projects required at Salt Lake Community College.
All of the different web pages were projects required in all of the classes involved with the Web Development Certificate Program.
All projects were required while I was attending the college. These web pages criterea have most likely changed since I took them.

## Why?
To show that after learning HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, JSON, and JQUERY at SLCC(Salt Lake Community College) I can take those same
techniques and use them in a new and popular framework that I learned via Udemy. Also because I can and it's fun. Right?
