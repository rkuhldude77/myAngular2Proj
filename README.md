# MyAngular2Proj

Conversion of HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, JSON, and Jquery to the new Angular 2 framework.
Using Bootstrap for css.

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.24.
angular-cli has been updated for this project to version 1.3.0

## Purpose
This project was created in an effort to reproduce all of the web design projects required at Salt Lake Community College.
All of the different web pages were projects required in all of the classes involved with the Web Development Certificate Program.
All projects were required while I was attending the college. These web pages criteria have most likely changed since I took them.
If anyone is taking the first round of web programming courses and runs across this git project, feel free to check it out and
see how I did some of my work. Use mine as an example to help you make your own.

## Why?
To show that after learning HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, JSON, and JQUERY at SLCC(Salt Lake Community College) I can take those same
techniques and use them in a new and popular framework that I learned via Udemy. Also because I can and it's fun. Right?

## Updates When Possible
I work part time and am going to school full time to finish up my Bachelors Degree. This will be updated when I have time. Once I
have all web design projects converted and uploaded I will remove this section from the README file.
